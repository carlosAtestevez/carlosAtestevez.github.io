<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

In this EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) we will conduct an analysis of beers sold across the United States. In addition, we will show deep analysis across different beer names, styles, and companies to shed more light into some of the weakness and advantages of certain business strategies.

This analysis will be presented to the Budweiser corporation. We will analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods to be more compressive.  Our main goal will be to recognize the areas where the company can focus aiming to strengthen its position in the market and ultimately translate these benefits to the final customer.

<h3><strong>Data Cleansing and Setting global variables</strong></h3>
<p>
<h4><strong>Addressing the missing values in each column</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
In this section, we will perform data cleansing. Data Cleaning is one of the important steps in EDA. Data cleaning can be done in many ways. One of them is handling missing values
   We will implement different methods for IBU and ABV
    -   ABV: Replace missing values with the arithmetic mean
    -   IBU: Replace missing values using KnnImputation method
</p>
<p>


```{r DataCleanandModel, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

#Cleaning ABV using mean
df_beers_cl0 = df_beers
nr_mean_abv = mean(df_beers_cl0[!is.na(df_beers_cl0$ABV),]$ABV) #Calculate the mean
length_abv = length(df_beers_cl0[is.na(df_beers_cl0$ABV),]$ABV) 
if(length_abv > 0){
  df_beers_cl0[is.na(df_beers_cl0$ABV),]$ABV = nr_mean_abv      #Replacing Missing value with mean
}

#Cleaning IBU using mean
df_beers_cl1 = df_beers
nr_mean_ibu = mean(df_beers_cl1[!is.na(df_beers_cl1$IBU),]$IBU)
length_ibu = length(df_beers_cl1[is.na(df_beers_cl1$IBU),]$IBU)
if(length_ibu > 0){
  df_beers_cl1[is.na(df_beers_cl1$IBU),]$IBU = nr_mean_ibu
}


#Cleaning using KnnInpute
##Creating the model K = 20
knn_imp_model <- preProcess(df_beers_cl0 %>% 
                          select(ABV,IBU),
                            method = c("knnImpute"),
                            k = 20,
                            knnSummary = mean)


#Running the model
df_beers_unp <- predict(knn_imp_model, df_beers_cl0,na.action = na.pass)
#The beer data set will be normalized. To de-normalize and get the original data back:
procNames <- data.frame(col = names(knn_imp_model$mean), mean = knn_imp_model$mean, sd = knn_imp_model$std)
for(i in procNames$col){
 df_beers_unp[i] <- df_beers_unp[i]*knn_imp_model$std[i]+knn_imp_model$mean[i] 
}

```
<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
After replacing the missing values of both variables(ABV and IBU) the resulting data distribution looks very similar to the initial distribution. The most challenging was the IBU activity because of the large number of observations(1005). In the end, the Knn process was very effective and the results look very good in the plot.

<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
This analysis is very meaningful because Budweiser can design marketing 
and advertising strategies in the states with a larger number of breweries
like California and Colorado.

```

<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
This analysis is also very meaningful. They can improve customer service
in the breweries with the highest Customer Demand. In that sense, They might increase the sales demand by offering better services in these areas.

```
<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
This analysis can be very strategic too. Budweiser can allocate beer types
according to different Consumer tastes and preferences. For example, the people in Kansas
prefer drinks with a low level of alcohol, Budweiser can negotiate better conditions with the breweries in Kansas in order to have more stock of drinks with a lower level of ABV aiming to meet the customer demand

```
<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
This analysis can reinforce the previous analysis. Again, Budweiser can allocate beer types according to the different Consumer tastes and preferences aiming to atract more clients and increase the sales revenue. We can see from the map that Colorado 
is a state with a high level of ABV preference. Budweiser can lunch more IPA beers(Higher level of ABV and IBU) in this state and increment sales..

ABV has a moderately right skewed distribution for following reasons
<ul>
<li>The Mean is slightly greater than the Median

```
<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
As we can see from the image the observations of the IPA beer types have higher levels of bitterness and alcohol. The opposite is also true. The ALE Beer Types have fewer levels of IBU and ABV.
The KNN accuracy also is very high. That means there’s a clear difference between IPA beers and the rest</p>

```
<p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
</p>
<p>
The map shows the information about the number of beers or SKU by state in the United States
For example we can notice that state such as California has a large number of beers by style 183 and states like Dakota has only 3 beers by style
This data will play an important role in two different areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising strategy
<li>Inventory management
</ul>
<p>
It is a great idea to invest capital in advertising strategy in states like California and Colorado because of the level of consumption of beer. We don’t have selling information however, we can notice by the wide assortment of California that the demand of beer is really high and more importantly the customers are willing to purchase more style of beers. On the other side, it doesn’t make sense to invest too much money in States like Dakota because it seems that demand of beers is very low.
In terms of Inventory Management, it is recommendable to keep a high service level and a good safety stock in states like California or Colorado aiming to provide a great customer service. We have to prevent getting stock out in those states since it seems they bring the most profit to the company.
