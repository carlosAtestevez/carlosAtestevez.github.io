<h3><strong>Interests</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
From an early age, Iâ€™ve wanted to pursue a career within the computing industry. Computers have always given me a platform to emphasize my creativity and increase my general knowledge.

When I was four years old my father gave me a wooden chess game. I was attracted by chess right away, I learned how to move the pieces on the chess board and eventually, I acquired the knowledge of playing the game(At least a basic level). I was fascinated by the game of chess, and the different strategies and plans you need to elaborate to defeat your opponent. I became involved very rapidly reading plenty of books, especially books written by Bobby Fisher. Being involved in the game of chess was very convenient to me since I became fascinated with other related topics that will be convenient for my future career like mathematics and statistics.  

My interest in computer science began when I was twelve years old watching a chess game between Gary Kasparov and IBM Chess Computer: Deep Blue(A chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer). I was awed by Deep Blue in terms of analyzing the different strategies and choosing the best possible play, it seemed that Deep Blue was really thinking. At the end of the match, Deep Blue beat Kasparov and from that point, I fell in love with computers. At that time, I had a friend whose father by the way was working at IBM. He invited me to his house one summer and I told him that I wanted to program computers and solve real-life problems. He told me that I had to learn how computers work and more importantly, how to instruct computers on what to do. After that, He gave me two books: C Programming Language by Dennis Ritchey and Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by the "Gang of Four". I learned the foundations of computer science including how to write programs, how to compile them, designing programs using the less possible computer resources, and how to develop an application using design patterns and Oriented Object Programming. </div>
